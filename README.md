# Becode_Ecommerce-backend

AS part of my Becode training, I had to code my own version of the [fake-store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It's a kind of clone with a little less search functionnality.

It allowed me to learn no-SQL databases with **MongoDB**, and to expand my knowledge of **Node.js** with **Express** and **JWT**.
