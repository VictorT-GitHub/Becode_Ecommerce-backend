# Becode_Ecommerce-backend

AS part of my Becode training, I had to code my own version of the [fake-store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It's a kind of clone with a little less search functionnality.

It allowed me to learn no-SQL databases with **MongoDB**, and to expand my knowledge of **Node**, **Express** and **JWT**.

**MongoDB** - **Mongoose** - **Node.js** - **Express.js** - **JWT**

(HEROKU is not free anymore. I will host my projects somewhere else. Thanks for your patience ðŸ¤—)
