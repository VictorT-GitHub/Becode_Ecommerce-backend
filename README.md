# Becode_Ecommerce-backend

AS part of my Becode training, I had to code my own version of the [fake-store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). It's a kind of clone with a little less search functionnality.

It allowed me to expand my knowledge of **Node.js** with **Express.js**, and to learn how to use **MongoDB** and no-SQL databases.
